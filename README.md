Dex is an OpenID Connect server that connects to other identity providers. Clients use a standards-based OAuth2 flow to login users, while the actual authentication is performed by established user management systems such as Google, GitHub, FreeIPA, etc.

[OpenID Connect][openid-connect] is a flavor of OAuth that builds on top of OAuth2 using the JOSE standards. This allows dex to provide:

* Short-lived, signed tokens with standard fields (such as email) issued on behalf of users.
* "well-known" discovery of OAuth2 endpoints.
* OAuth2 mechanisms such as refresh tokens and revocation for long term access.
* Automatic signing key rotation.

Standards-based token responses allows applications to interact with any OpenID Connect server instead of writing backend specific "access_token" dances. Systems that can already consume ID Tokens issued by dex include:

* [Kubernetes][kubernetes]
* [AWS STS][aws-sts]

## Kubernetes + dex

Dex's main production use is as an auth-N addon in CoreOS's enterprise Kubernetes solution, [Tectonic][tectonic]. Dex runs natively on top of any Kubernetes cluster using Third Party Resources and can drive API server authentication through the OpenID Connect plugin. Clients, such as the [Tectonic Console][tectonic-console] and `kubectl`, can act on behalf users who can login to the cluster through any identity provider dex supports.

More docs for running dex as a Kubernetes authenticator can be found [here](Documentation/kubernetes.md).
